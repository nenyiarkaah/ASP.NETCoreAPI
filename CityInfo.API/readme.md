Building Your First API with ASP.NET Core

by Kevin Dockx

Microsoft is moving towards a new direction with its developer frameworks, signified by the cross-platform, modular, and faster ASP.NET Core 1.x/2.0 and Entity Framework Core 1.x/2.0. In this course, you'll learn how to build an API with these.

Both ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core have been built from the ground up, and a lot has changed. ASP.NET Core isn't an upgrade to ASP.NET, it's a new framework altogether. In this course, Building Your First API with ASP.NET Core, you'll learn about the important concepts of ASP.NET Core related to building an API, like working with middleware, MVC, services, and Dependency Injection. First, you'll start out with the basics to ASP.NET Core including how such a project is structured. Next, you'll explore how to implement all the functionality you'd expect from an API. Finally, you'll discover how to create a database using a code-first approach and how to work with migrations. After this course, you'll have a good understanding of what ASP.NET Core is and how to build an API with it.
